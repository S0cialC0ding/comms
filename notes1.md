- Multiple users points can be distributed in one message

#### Aragon Planning Tab (Deam)
- Most front end done, need integration from front end to back end. 
- Kay: Make announcment for testing and deployment, clarify the documentation. 

#### Smart Withdrawl (Deam)
- What about a contract where you can only use a limited amount of ETH per day. 
- Provide a real password
- Hash the secret at first, enter that into the contract.
- If you want to send all your ETH you provide a plain text password. 
- Users can only withdraw the daily limit. 
- Create contract with all your ETH in it, only for yourself. Using the limited daily withdraw password. 
- Thoughts ??? Sounds possible, not a lot of response. 



#### EthKan (XET7)
- Needs more people, still need to clarify the needs of the project. 


### Open thoughts 
- Push social coding repo 
- Fork your project back into Social Coding 
- XET7 Books: making a public book that is not visable.
- Many issues that can be worked on, when EthKan uses Wekan. 
- Easy intro for contributor to start learning and make quick progress.
